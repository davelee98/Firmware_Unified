# Vendored third-party code

Origin, revision, licence, and pruning for every tree under `third_party/`.

README.md § License requires this: *"Vendored third-party code keeps its own licence and its
own notice; do not relicense it on the way in. Record the origin and licence of each vendored
tree."* MIGRATION.md § "Risks to watch" adds the rule that decided the pruning below: *"Decide
what a blob's pruned form is before its first commit, not after it has been bumped twice."*

`third_party/` is deliberately **outside `shared/`** and is not scanned by the boundary check.
`bb_epaper` selects its IO backend by `#ifdef` and every backend includes vendor headers, so it
can never satisfy the `shared/` rule — but it is still *one* vendored copy for all targets, not
a per-target fork. Do not "fix" this by moving it into `shared/`.

## bb_epaper

> **RESOLVED 2026-08-04 -- bb_epaper needs NO Arduino surface on this target.** The open
> decision below ("replacing `esp_generic.inl` with an in-project backend as the other two
> targets already did") was taken: `targets/esp32-idf/panel/od_bbep.cpp` replaces the vendored
> `bb_epaper.cpp` and supplies our own IDF backend, `panel/od_bbep_idf_io.inl`. Consequences
> worth stating, because earlier notes across this repo assumed otherwise:
>
> * **Zero edits to vendored files.** The glue TU is replaced rather than its `#ifdef` chain
>   patched, so there is no fifth `OD-PATCH` and nothing new joins the re-verify list.
> * `arduino_io.inl` and `esphome_io.inl` are **never compiled**, and `bb_epaper.h`'s
>   `#include <Arduino.h>` sits behind `#ifdef ARDUINO`, which this build does not define.
> * Dropping the unused `BBEPAPER` C++ class removed the only consumer of `pinMode()` (13
>   calls) and `millis()` (6), which is why the backend contract is nine functions, not eleven.
>
> **So the FastEPD vendor adapter is FastEPD's alone.** Any text claiming the permanent adapter
> exists for both libraries, or that it must own `delay()`/`delayMicroseconds()`/`millis()`/
> `ledc_compat.h`, predates this and is wrong.
>
> **`third_party/bb_epaper/src` is no longer on the component include path** (2026-08-04).
> `main/CMakeLists.txt` grants it per-source; an unlisted file including `<bb_epaper.h>` fails
> to compile. Same for `third_party/FastEPD/src`. This is containment, not abstraction -- the
> destination is `od_hal_panel` / `od_panel_ops`.

> **Backend analysis:** [docs/BBEPAPER_IO_BACKENDS.md](../docs/BBEPAPER_IO_BACKENDS.md) covers how
> bb_epaper selects an IO backend, the five-function contract a backend must satisfy, a
> function-by-function comparison of `esp_generic.inl` against `arduino_io.inl` (the backend the

| Author | Larry Bank (BitBank Software, Inc.) |
| Upstream | https://github.com/bitbank2/bb_epaper |
| Vendored from | https://github.com/davelee98-creator/bb_epaper — a fork, **now fast-forwarded to upstream and carrying no unique commits** (verified: `git log upstream/main..main` is empty) |
| Revision | `5dccfbb` ("Added support for the Seeed reTerminal E1004 and its 13.3 Spectra6 1200x1600 panel") |
| Licence | **GPL-3.0-or-later** |
| Vendored | 2026-07-25 at the ESP32 phase-B import; **re-vendored 2026-08-05** (was `2ef09a1`, "Fixed 4.26 again") |

**Pruned on the way in — 6.6 MB → 492 KB.** Kept `src/`, the four `esp_idf/*.inl` backends,
`CMakeLists.txt`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`. Dropped the example projects under `esp_idf/`
(`Spectra6`, `mini_epaper_s3`, `hello_world_c`, `hello_world_cpp`), `Fonts/`, `examples/`,
`fontconvert/`, `imageconvert/`, and the `ch32v`/`macos`/`rpi`/`rpi_pico` ports. None is
reachable from a firmware build.

### Re-vendor 2026-08-05 — what the bump changed

Taken for `s3-e1004`: upstream added `EPD_SEEED_E1004` / `EP133_SPECTRA_1200x1600`, the 13.3"
Spectra6 panel that board needs and that no earlier revision had. 76 panels → 78.

**IT WAS NOT A DROP-IN. The backend contract changed twice**, and both breaks were compile
errors rather than silent behaviour changes, which is the only reason this was cheap:

1. **`iCS1Pin` was REMOVED** from `BBEPDISP`. `iCSPin` *is* CS1 now, and dual-controller panels
   are addressed through a new `cs_mode` field (`CMD_CS1` / `CMD_CS2` / `CMD_CS1_CS2`) instead
   of mutating `iCSPin` around each write. Both target backends set `iCS1Pin` and the Zephyr
   composite helpers restored CS through it; all of that is gone.
2. **`bbepWriteCmdData()` joined the contract** — `bb_ep.inl` calls it directly, so a backend
   without it no longer links. Both backends now implement it, modelled on `arduino_io.inl`:
   command byte with DC low then payload with DC high, all inside ONE CS assertion.

`cs_mode` gating went in at each backend's single CS seam rather than at the eight sites
`arduino_io.inl` repeats it across. Both treat `cs_mode == 0` as `CMD_CS1`, because a
memset-zeroed `BBEPDISP` — which is how both targets create theirs — would otherwise assert no
CS line at all and the panel would sit silent.

### Local patches — re-verified at the 2026-08-05 bump

**One of the three retired: upstream fixed it.** `bb_ep.inl` no longer defines
`epd42yr_init_full` twice, and the panel table references the surviving definition correctly.
The `OD-PATCH` is deleted rather than carried, and the re-verify list shrinks to two.

The other two are still unfixed upstream and are re-applied:

The tree does not compile as vendored. Two defects, each fixed with a one-line change tagged
`OD-PATCH` so a future bump can find them:

1. ~~`src/bb_ep.inl` defined `epd42yr_init_full` twice~~ — **FIXED UPSTREAM at `5dccfbb`; patch
   retired 2026-08-05.**
2. **`src/bb_epaper.h` declared `void delay(int)` while `esp_idf/esp_generic.inl` defines
   `void delay(long)`.** Two different overloads of the library's own function, so any
   `delay(uint32_t)` call inside the library was ambiguous. The declaration now says `long`.

Both are bugs in the library itself, not incompatibilities with this repo — worth reporting
upstream, and worth checking against `bitbank2/bb_epaper` to see whether the fork introduced
them. Re-apply or re-verify on every bump.

### `esp_idf/esp_generic.inl` is UNPATCHED and UNUSED (reverted 2026-08-03)

This file is byte-identical to upstream `~/bb_epaper/esp_idf/esp_generic.inl` (295 lines) and
**is not compiled.** Do not patch it. Do not read it to understand how this target drives a
panel — it does not.

The ESP32 target uses its own backend, `targets/esp32-idf/panel/od_bbep_idf_io.inl`, selected by
`targets/esp32-idf/panel/od_bbep.cpp` replacing `bb_epaper.cpp`'s 52 lines of glue rather than
by patching its `#ifdef` chain. That is why nothing here needs an `OD-PATCH` any more, and why
`bb_epaper.cpp` is excluded in `main/CMakeLists.txt`.

**It carried four `OD-PATCH` sites and they are all gone.** Kept for the record, because the
history is the argument for owning the backend rather than patching upstream's:

1. **`bbepInitIO()` was not re-entrant** — it called `spi_bus_initialize()` on every cold panel
   bring-up while the file contained no `spi_bus_free()` anywhere, so bring-up #2 could only
   `assert()`. `epdSessionAcquire()` re-acquires the panel per transfer, making the panic
   guaranteed on the first image upload after the boot screen. Invisible under Arduino, which
   used `src/arduino_io.inl` and shared the application's global `SPI` object, so
   `SPI.begin()`/`SPI.end()` happened to pair across the library boundary.
2. **The first fix for (1) was wrong**, and instructively so: guarding the block behind an
   "already initialised" flag stranded SCLK/MOSI, because project code revokes the pad routing
   between bring-ups (`configureDisplayPinsLowPower()` → `pinMode()` → `gpio_config()`) and
   `spi_bus_initialize()` is the only call that restores it. The peripheral stayed healthy and
   connected to nothing: every transfer returned `ESP_OK` and the screen never changed.
3. Two supporting edits — an `esp_log.h` include so the file could warn at all, and `#if 0`
   around its Arduino-core/libc reimplementation (`delay`, `millis`, `mymemset`, `i2str`, …)
   which collided with `compat/arduino_compat.h`.

None of that was the cause of the 16–21 s cold bring-up it was chased for; that was BUSY-wait
expiry inside `bb_ep.inl`, measured at 5 s a time. See
[docs/BBEPAPER_IO_BACKENDS.md](../docs/BBEPAPER_IO_BACKENDS.md) § 8.

**Why the file is reverted rather than deleted.** A re-vendor would restore it, so deleting it
makes the vendored tree diverge from upstream by omission — harder to verify than a file that
matches. Pristine and unused is a state a `diff` against upstream confirms in one command;
absent is not.

## FastEPD

| Author | Larry Bank |
| Upstream | https://github.com/bitbank2/FastEPD |
| Revision | `770e168d695e693688053560d9a8d296a0dbc967` ("changed to taskYIELD") |
| Licence | **Apache-2.0** |
| Vendored | 2026-07-25, at the ESP32 phase-B import |
| Scope | **ESP32-S3 only, and PSRAM-mandatory** — parallel e-paper via the S3 LCD peripheral |

**Pruned on the way in — 13 MB → 380 KB.** Kept `src/`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`,
`library.properties`. Dropped `examples/` (8.2 MB), `Fonts/` (1.6 MB), `Linux/`, `fontconvert/`,
`imageconvert/`.

Apache-2.0 code vendored inside a GPL-3.0 work is fine; the combined work is GPL-3.0 and this
tree keeps its own licence and notice. Do not relicense it.

### The vendored bb_epaper cannot build `s3-e1004` — wrong fork

`env:esp32-s3-E1004` in the source repo pins a **different bb_epaper fork** from the one
vendored here:

| | |
|---|---|
| Vendored | `davelee98-creator/bb_epaper` @ `2ef09a1` |
| Required by E1004 | `limengdu/bb_epaper` @ `95fd94af` — limengdu's PR bitbank2#32, T133A01 support |

The vendored copy defines neither `BBEP_T133A01` nor the `EP133A_SPECTRA_1200x1600` panel
enum. `display_service.cpp:700` maps `OD_PANEL_IC_EP133A_SPECTRA_1200X1600` onto that enum,
and the whole E1004 dual-CS stream is behind `#ifdef BBEP_T133A01` — which is why the current
build compiles: the guard is false everywhere and `e1004_write_stream_bytes()` is a no-op stub.

**So `boards/s3-e1004.cmake` is deliberately absent.** Writing the fragment would produce a
board that builds and cannot drive its own panel — the exact failure mode this repo's audit
has been removing. It needs one of:

1. re-vendor bb_epaper from a revision containing the T133A01 work (upstream if bitbank2#32
   has merged since, otherwise the limengdu fork the source env pins), then add the fragment
   with `BBEP_T133A01` defined; **and**
2. fix `e1004_write_stream_bytes()`, which calls `SPI.writeBytes()` while nothing calls
   `SPI.begin()`. Under Arduino it shared the global SPI object with bb_epaper; under IDF
   bb_epaper owns its own `SPI2_HOST` bus and device, so those bytes must go through
   bb_epaper's existing device handle — the one that just sent `DTM1` — not a second handle
   on the shim.

Item 2 is a live defect today, merely unreachable. Do not add the board without it.

### FastEPD has no ESP-IDF IO backend — OD-PATCH applied

FastEPD picks its IO backend with `#ifdef ARDUINO` / `#elif defined(__LINUX__)`. There is no
third arm, and under ESP-IDF **neither macro is defined**. That is not a compile error: every
`it8951*` transport function in `FastEPD.inl` simply collapsed to an *empty body between two
`gpio_set_level()` calls*.

The consequences were invisible to the build and to the boot log:

- `it8951WriteCmdCode` / `it8951WriteData` / `it8951WriteNData` transmitted nothing
- `it8951ReadData` / `it8951ReadNData` returned 0, so the controller probe read all zeros
- the GPIO reset/busy/power handshake still ran, so the panel *looked* alive

`bbepInitIT8951` therefore "succeeded" against a panel that had never received a byte. Only an
IT8951-over-SPI panel is affected; the parallel ED103 path drives the S3 LCD peripheral and
never went through this code.

**The patch.** All 15 guarded SPI blocks become
`#if defined(ARDUINO) || defined(OD_FASTEPD_IDF_SPI)`, and
`targets/esp32-idf/main/CMakeLists.txt` sets `OD_FASTEPD_IDF_SPI=1` on `FastEPD.cpp` alone.
The Arduino branch is reused verbatim because `targets/esp32-idf/compat/SPI.h` provides exactly
that API over IDF's `spi_master`. Patched sites are marked `OD-PATCH` and all point at the
explanatory note on `it8951WriteData()`.

> **This section previously claimed "every affected guard" when only six were patched**, and
> `targets/esp32-idf/README.md` § "Known defects" was right to call the claim wrong. The six

> `bbepInitIT8951`. The **nine** in `it8951WriteFramebuffer{1,2,4}Bit` — three each: open

**Why not just define `ARDUINO`.** Tried, and rejected: it also selects FastEPD's Arduino
font/`Print`/`PROGMEM` surface (`pgm_read_*`, `memcpy_P`, `ledcAttach`, `TwoWire::setTimeout`)
— an entire Arduino core rather than an IO backend — and `bb_epaper` reads the same macro to
choose *its* backend and must keep the `esp_idf` one.

**Retiring it.** The upstream-shaped fix is an `esp_idf_io.inl` in FastEPD selected by
`ESP_PLATFORM`. When that exists, delete both the patch and the CMake define. Until then, note
that `compat/` cannot be removed at the end of phase C while FastEPD still depends on it —
`compat/ratchet.sh` reports these vendored users separately for exactly that reason.

## The Group5 collision — the same code, twice, under two licences

`bb_epaper` and `FastEPD` **both ship `Group5.cpp`, `Group5.h`, `bb_ep_gfx.inl`, `g5dec.inl`,
`g5enc.inl` and `arduino_io.inl`.** Same author, overlapping history — and the copies are *not*
identical. The licence headers differ:

```
bb_epaper/src/Group5.cpp:  SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
FastEPD/src/Group5.cpp:    (no SPDX header; FastEPD as a whole is Apache-2.0)
```

`Group5.cpp` is the only overlapping file that is *compiled* (the `.inl` files are includes), so
it is the only one that produces duplicate symbols at link time.

**The source repo's answer was `-Wl,--allow-multiple-definition`**, with the comment *"FastEPD
and bb_epaper both ship bb_ep_gfx/Group5; we only use FastEPD buffer+update APIs."* That flag
tells the linker to silently keep whichever definition it saw first — which means the effective
G5 codec depends on link order, and a divergence between the two copies becomes a bug nobody can
see in the source.

**This repo does not carry that flag.** MEMORY_CONSTRAINTS.md § "Open questions" recommends
option 1 — *compile the duplicated files from one library only* — and DESIGN_REVIEW § "Likely
pitfalls" #4 warns specifically that the flag must not ship "temporarily", because temporary
linker workarounds are exactly the class of thing that becomes permanent. It says to adopt
option 1 **before** phase B, not during. That is what `targets/esp32-idf/main/CMakeLists.txt`
does: on a FastEPD board it compiles `Group5.cpp` from FastEPD and excludes bb_epaper's; on a
non-FastEPD board only bb_epaper's exists and the question does not arise.

**Resolved 2026-07-26, and the collision was wider than Group5.cpp.** FastEPD and bb_epaper
also both carry `bb_ep_gfx.inl`, defining `bbepUnicodeTo1252`, `bbepUnicodeString`,
`RotateCharBox`, `bbepStretchAndSmooth` and `millis`. Excluding one copy does not work:
each library's own wrappers call into its copy, even though the application calls none of
them. **FastEPD's copy is therefore given internal linkage** (an anonymous namespace,
`OD-PATCH` in `FastEPD.cpp`) so both libraries keep a private copy and there is no
arbitrary linker winner. The duplicated text is mostly discarded as unreferenced.

The premise this rests on, from MEMORY_CONSTRAINTS: *"confirm both drawing APIs are not
simultaneously required on any single board first."* The `platformio.ini` comment asserts they
are not — only FastEPD's buffer/update APIs are used on those boards. **That assertion has not
been verified against the code**, and it is the thing to check before trusting this arrangement
on hardware.

## espressif/mdns — vendored under `targets/esp32-idf/components/mdns/`

**Not under `third_party/`, and that is deliberate.** It is an ESP-IDF *component*: it must sit
in a directory the IDF build system scans (`targets/esp32-idf/components/`) with its own
`CMakeLists.txt` and `Kconfig`, and it is ESP32-only by construction. It is recorded here
because this file is where vendored code is accounted for, not because of where it lives.

| Requires | ESP-IDF `>= 5.0`; this repo pins v5.5.4 |

**Why vendored rather than fetched.** ESP-IDF dropped `mdns` from its core components in v5.0,
so it exists only in the Espressif component registry. Taking it via `main/idf_component.yml`
would make the component manager — and therefore network access to the registry — a requirement
of every clean build and every CI run, and this build has no managed components at all today.
Vendoring keeps builds offline and byte-reproducible, at the cost of a copy to bump by hand.
Decided 2026-08-04.

**Pruned on the way in — 1.3 MB → 640 KB.** Kept the sources, `include/`, `private_include/`,
`CMakeLists.txt`, `Kconfig`, `idf_component.yml` (the build reads it for `COMPONENT_VERSION`,
which becomes `ESP_MDNS_VERSION_NUMBER`), `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`. Dropped
`examples/`, `tests/` (host tests, unit tests, test apps — ~600 KB), the upstream refactoring
notes (`refactor_2025.md`, `refactoring_details.md`, `mdns_diagram.md`), `.cz.yaml`, and
`mem_prefix_script.py`. None is reachable from a firmware build.

**No local patches.** The tree is byte-for-byte upstream 1.11.3 minus the pruning above. Keep it
that way: configuration belongs in `sdkconfig.defaults`, not in edits here.

**This device ADVERTISES ONLY — it never resolves.** There is no upstream build flag for that
(the querier and browser compile in regardless), so it is expressed in configuration: see
`sdkconfig.defaults` for the responder-only settings and what each one is worth.
