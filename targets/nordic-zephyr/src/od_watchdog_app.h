/* The target's owner of shared/core/od_watchdog.h.
 *
 * The shared controller holds no global state and does not log; something on each target has to
 * own the struct and turn the boot report into log lines. This is that, and it is deliberately
 * the whole of it -- no policy lives here. The ESP32 target carries the same five entry points
 * (targets/esp32-idf/src/od_watchdog_app.h); the logger and the clock are what differ, which is
 * exactly why this half could not be shared.
 *
 * THREADING. od_watchdog itself is lock-free and single-owner; this module is the owner and
 * serialises the callers on a spinlock, because unlike the reference -- one loop task doing
 * everything -- main() feeds here while the display work queue stamps breadcrumbs.
 *
 * od_watchdog_app_service() is still main()'s alone, and that is a rule, not a convention: a
 * feed must come from a site whose execution proves the program is alive. Never call it from a
 * work queue, timer or BLE callback.
 *
 * WHAT IS COVERED, AND WHAT IS NOT. main() is the only feeder, so what trips the watchdog is
 * main() ceasing to run. A wedge confined to the display work queue does NOT trip it -- main()
 * keeps feeding beside it -- and that is why the reference's feeds immediately before each
 * bb_epaper call are deliberately NOT reproduced here: on this target those calls happen on a
 * thread that is not the feeder, so adding feeds there would only widen the blind spot. The
 * breadcrumb phases ARE reproduced, and they are what names the wedge after the fact. Covering
 * the display thread properly needs a second watchdog channel, which the Zephyr API supports
 * and this does not yet use.
