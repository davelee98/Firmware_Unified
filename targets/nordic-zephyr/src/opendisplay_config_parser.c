/*
 * Config load for targets/nordic-zephyr.
 *
 * THE WALK AND THE STORE ARE BOTH SHARED NOW. What was here was a 530-line switch that
 * re-derived, per packet type, the offset arithmetic, the "does this fit" comparison against
 * configLen - 2, the instance caps, and its own CRC-16 and packet-size table. All of that is
 * shared/core/od_config_tlv.c (the walk) and shared/core/od_config.c (the store); what is left
 * is this target's own: reading the blob out of storage, and saying what happened.
 *
 * Two things this file used to do are deliberately NOT carried across:
 *
 *   rescan_security_packet(). It scanned the raw blob for an 0x27 the walk had stepped past, and
 *   existed because an unknown id ends the walk: a blob carrying 0x2C on a build that did not
 *   know 0x2C dropped the security packet behind it. The shared size table knows every canonical
 *   id, so the case it recovered from cannot arise for a canonical packet; keeping the scan would
 *   carry a workaround into the one path a client can write pre-auth, and would leave the next
 *   missing id silently survivable. See shared/core/od_config.h.
 *
 *   The per-packet "known-unparsed, skipping N bytes" arm. Every id in the table is dispatched
 *   and stored now, so there is no such thing as known-but-unparsed here.
