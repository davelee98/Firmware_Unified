 * string rather than a truncated id, because a truncated device id is worse than none -- it is
 * a DIFFERENT device as far as the host is concerned.
 *
 * Was `String getChipIdHex()`. Arduino's String is forbidden in shared/ outright (CLAUDE.md),
 * and this was the only one left on an interface rather than inside a function body, which is
 * why it is its own phase C step. Every caller already padded to six digits by hand; that is
 * now the contract instead of a convention. */
