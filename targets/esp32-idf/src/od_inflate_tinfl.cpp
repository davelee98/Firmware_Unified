/* ------------------------------------------------------- dictionary/ring size ---
 * This buffer serves TWO roles with DIFFERENT size requirements:
 *
 *  1) LZ77 history — the correctness FLOOR, equal to the DEFLATE window. A match can
 *     never reference further back than the window, so bytes beyond it are unreachable
 *     (never read as history). tinfl additionally REJECTS a stream whose CMF byte
 *     declares a window larger than this buffer — a clean decode error at the zlib
 *     header, never silent corruption — so the size must be >= the window.
 *
 *  2) Output staging ring — SPEED. tinfl's bulk paths need CONTIGUOUS headroom to the
 *     ring end: symbol decode wants a couple of bytes, and the 8-bytes-at-a-time match
 *     copy wants headroom >= the match length. DEFLATE's max match is 258 bytes
 *     (RFC 1951 length codes 257..285; cf. length_base[] in the portable inflater),
 *     so at a 512-byte ring a long match is often too close to the wrap and falls back
 *     to the slow byte-at-a-time copy. The share of output affected scales as
 *     match_len/ring_size, i.e. it halves per doubling with no threshold — ~50% at 512
 *     vs ~6% at 4096 for worst-case 258-byte matches. E-paper images have large uniform
 *     regions, which compress into long (often max-length) matches, so the worst case is
 *     representative here rather than rare.
 *
 * Sizing rule:
 *   - 9-bit window (512, the default): use 4096. The window alone leaves too little
 *     staging headroom; 4096 restores the bulk paths while still reclaiming ~28 KB of
 *     internal DRAM versus the old unconditional 32768.
 *   - window > 9 bits: use the window size exactly. It already provides ample headroom,
 *     so padding beyond the correctness floor would only waste DRAM.
 *     (env:esp32-s3-E1004 pins BITS=15 => 32768, unchanged.)
 *
 * Overridable per-env via -DOD_TINFL_DICT_SIZE=<power of 2> to trade RAM against speed.
 *
 * NOTE: the dictionary is OURS, not tinfl's — `tinfl_decompressor` holds only the
 * Huffman tables, and tinfl takes the ring as a caller-supplied buffer, so this array
 * is the whole cost. TINFL_LZ_DICT_SIZE (32768) is a bare SDK #define that allocates
 * nothing; it is deliberately NOT redefined here.
