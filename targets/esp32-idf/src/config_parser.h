// Chunked CONFIG_WRITE reassembly state moved to shared/core/od_config_asm.h (F3, 2026-08-05).
// The local chunked_write_state_t is GONE: its shape checks and bounds were the defect, and a
// per-target copy of the state is what let the bound and the buffer it guards be sized in two
// different files. The object now lives in communication.cpp as `g_configAsm`.

/**
 * Clear the chunked config-upload state.
 *
 * The single primitive for it. The three sites in communication.cpp that used to
 * clear it inline each zeroed a different subset -- one set only `active`, another
 * also the counters, none the totals -- so a teardown routed through the wrong one
 * left a partially-live upload. abortToKnownState() calls this too, which is what
 * gives session teardown any coverage of this state at all: it previously had no
 * reset function, so no disconnect path and no watchdog touched it.
 *
 * The payload buffer is deliberately not zeroed: `active = false` makes it
 * unreachable, and OD_CONFIG_MAX_SIZE is large enough that clearing it on every
 * teardown would be pointless work.
