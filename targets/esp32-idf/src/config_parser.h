 * clear it inline each zeroed a different subset -- one set only `active`, another
 * also the counters, none the totals -- so a teardown routed through the wrong one
 * left a partially-live upload. abortToKnownState() calls this too, which is what
 * gives session teardown any coverage of this state at all: it previously had no
 * reset function, so no disconnect path and no watchdog touched it.
 *
 * The payload buffer is deliberately not zeroed: `active = false` makes it
 * unreachable, and MAX_CONFIG_SIZE is large enough that clearing it on every
 * teardown would be pointless work.
