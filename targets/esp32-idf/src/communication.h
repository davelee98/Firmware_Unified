 * INGRESS that has it: BLE from the RX slot's own tag, LAN from the live owner word. It used to be
 * reconstructed here from a pair of globals the caller had set immediately beforehand, which is a
 * frame context that outlives its frame -- readable by any nested or later path after the caller
 * has moved on, and impossible for the compiler to check.
 *
 * Returns the outcome so the ingress can honour od_frame_policy().consume_rx: OD_FRAME_DEFERRED
 * means the frame was NOT consumed and must be re-offered unchanged, and an ingress that drops it

// Declared here rather than in ble_transport.h because they are application
// policy, not link state -- and because neither is BLE-specific: the cleanup
// request is raised by the LAN transport on a LAN disconnect.
