/* od_rxq_app.cpp -- this target's answers to shared/core/od_rxq_app.h.
 *
 * The arrival and drop lines are no longer here: od_rxq.c logs them, one wording for both
 * targets. What is left is the two facts the shared line cannot answer from the ring -- whether
 * the CCM envelope is in force, and whether an opcode's per-frame line should be suppressed.
 *
 * Both run on the STACK CALLBACK TASK and are only reached in a build compiled at OD_LOG_DEBUG.
