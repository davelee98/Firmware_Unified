// ESP32 implementation of BleTransport.
//
// The whole file is gated on TARGET_ESP32, so an nRF build compiles it to an
// empty translation unit.
//
// PORTED FROM THE REFERENCE FIRMWARE, WITH ONE SUBSTITUTION. Upstream this file
// drives NimBLE-Arduino (h2zero) and keeps "every NimBLE object as file-static
// state" inside itself. ESP-IDF does not ship that library -- BLE here is
// NimBLE's own C API, wrapped by ../ble/od_ble.h -- so every stack call below
// goes through od_ble_* and the stack objects live one file down. The property
// the upstream comment was protecting is unchanged: nothing outside ble/ names a
// NimBLE type.
//
// Everything ELSE is upstream's, deliberately and near-verbatim: the instance
// table, the epoch/claim protocol, the atomics and their ordering, the write
// filter, the owner-targeted notify, and the event flags. Those encode
// CONNECTION_POLICY, which is target-independent -- re-deriving them for this
// target is exactly the "divergence settled by whichever repo was copied first"
// that docs/MIGRATION.md forbids. Where the mechanism genuinely differs it is
// marked OD-PORT with the reason.
//
// Threading contract, identical on both targets: a stack callback may copy bytes
// into the RX ring, publish its own instance-table entry, attempt the single
// ownership claim CAS, and set an event flag. Everything else -- dispatch,
// decrypt, EPD streaming, notify(), the connect/disconnect application work --
// runs on the loop() task. Here the callbacks arrive as the od_ble_evt_* hooks,
// which od_ble.h declares under exactly that contract.
//
// The claim is the one thing beyond "copy and flag", and it belongs here because
// the write filter must be able to test ownership before any loop pass runs.
