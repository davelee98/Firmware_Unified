#   ./build.sh --clean             # wipe each board's build dir first
#
# Each board produces ONE file, release/opendisplay-<board>-merged.bin, flashed at offset 0:
#
#   python -m esptool --chip <chip> write_flash 0x0 release/opendisplay-<board>-merged.bin
#
# The chip is not guessable from the filename, so release/MANIFEST.txt records it per image
# along with the size and the source commit. Do not infer it -- flashing an esp32c3 image to
# an esp32c6 is a soft brick that reads as a bad cable.
#
# WHY MERGED IMAGES. The four-image form (bootloader / partition table / OTA data / app) has
# per-chip offsets: the classic ESP32 puts its bootloader at 0x1000, every other variant here
# at 0x0. That is the single most common flashing mistake, and it fails as "boots to a
# bootloop" rather than as an error. The merge is done by CMakeLists.txt on every build from
# IDF's own flash_args, so the offsets are never transcribed by hand and the image can never
# be stale relative to the build.
#
# This script does NOT flash. Attaching a board is a separate, deliberate act; see the
# per-image command in the manifest.

# advisory: an IDF minor bump changes generated startup code, the bootloader, and sdkconfig
# defaults, and those land in a merged image nobody diffs.

#   OD_IDF_VERSION_CHECK=warn ./build.sh     # note the mismatch, build anyway
#   OD_IDF_VERSION_CHECK=off  ./build.sh     # say nothing
