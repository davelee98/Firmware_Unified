/* od_hal_adc -- one-shot ADC reads.
 *
 * Not in docs/SHARED_API_DESIGN.md at all. The core does not read analogue inputs; this exists
 * because two TARGET drivers do -- device_control.cpp's ADC button ladder and
 * display_service.cpp's battery sense -- and IDF's oneshot driver has one unit handle that
 * both must share.
 *
 * ADC1 ONLY, deliberately. ADC2 shares its hardware with the WiFi radio on ESP32/S2/S3 and
 * reads fail with ESP_ERR_TIMEOUT whenever WiFi is up -- and this target's boards run WiFi. A
 * pin that maps to ADC2 is reported unreadable rather than read unreliably.
 *
 * WHY A ZERO RETURN IS DANGEROUS HERE, and why this interface keeps a separate "is it
 * readable" question: both callers turn a reading into something a host believes.
 * readBatteryVoltageUncached() multiplies by a scaling factor and publishes the result in the
 * MSD advert, so 0 becomes a plausible 0.0 V rather than the -1.0 "unknown" sentinel it uses
 * when no sense pin is configured. The button ladder classifies 0 into its catch-all bottom
 * bucket, which reads as the last button permanently pressed. That is the exact failure the
 * original `return 0` stub produced, and it is why od_hal_adc_pin_readable() exists rather
 * than leaving every caller to infer failure from a value that is also a legal reading.
