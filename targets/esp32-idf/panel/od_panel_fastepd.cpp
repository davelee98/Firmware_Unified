/* od_panel_fastepd -- the FastEPD backend of od_hal_panel.
 *
 * A THIN adapter over src/display_fastepd.cpp, deliberately: that file is the working IT8951 /
 * Inkplate driver and MIGRATION.md's "rewriting working drivers" is an explicit non-goal. What
 * this file adds is only what the HAL contract requires and the driver does not provide --
 * chiefly the non-blocking refresh (correction 3) and symmetric error returns (correction 4).
 *
 * BUFFERED BACKEND: FastEPD holds a full frame in PSRAM and blits it, so caps.needs_framebuffer
 * is true and a partial update can be composed from what is already there. That is the opposite
 * of the bb_epaper backend and is exactly why the caps query exists.
