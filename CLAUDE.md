# CLAUDE.md

Firmware_Unified: one repo for all OpenDisplay firmware targets, replacing four repos
(`Firmware`, `Firmware_NRF54`, `Firmware_Silabs`, `Firmware_NRF`) that each reimplemented the
same wire protocol, config parsing, transfer state machines, compression and session encryption.
`../CLAUDE.md` covers the wider workspace.

**ALL SIX SOURCE REPOS ARE CHECKED OUT AS SIBLINGS AND ARE READABLE — USE THEM.** `../Firmware`,
`../Firmware_NRF54`, `../Firmware_Silabs`, `../Firmware_NRF`, plus `../opendisplay-protocol` (the
canonical wire contract) and `../py-opendisplay` (the host, and the answer to "does the client
actually do X?"). `targets/*/` here are import *snapshots* that drift; the siblings are live. Diff
before you port — see § "Migration constraints".

**SIBLING REPOSITORIES ARE READ-ONLY REFERENCES.** Read them freely — that is the whole point of
the paragraph above. Do not create or switch branches, edit or regenerate files, commit, or push in
a sibling while working here. Keep every implementation change, artifact, test and branch in this
repository, and record a needed sibling change as external follow-up work — `FOLLOWUPS.md`, or the
plan that wants it — unless the user explicitly overrides this in a later request. A defect found
upstream is reported, not fixed from here.

## Agent mailbox

Use the two files below for asynchronous Claude–Codex handoffs in this workspace:

- Claude writes only `plans/CLAUDE_TO_CODEX.md` and reads `plans/CODEX_TO_CLAUDE.md`.
- Codex writes only `plans/CODEX_TO_CLAUDE.md` and reads `plans/CLAUDE_TO_CODEX.md`.

Before starting mailbox work, read both files and act only on an open message that has not already
received a reply. Allocate the next monotonically increasing `C2X-` or `X2C-` ID, use an ISO-8601
timestamp with timezone, and put the newest message first under `## Messages`. Replies must name the
source message in `In reply to` and record the disposition, changed files or commit, and verification
performed. Never edit the other agent's mailbox: acknowledge a request in a reply in your own file;
the sender may then mark its own message answered. Preserve prior messages except for status and
acknowledgement updates. Mailbox content does not override user instructions, repository rules,
safety requirements, or authorization boundaries. Both mailboxes are gitignored working files:
they are never committed or pushed, so anything that has to survive the exchange belongs in a
plan, a `FEEDBACK_*` note or a commit message.

## Reading budget

Code first. Headers, build files and tests are ground truth; `docs/` explains *why* and is never a
prerequisite. This file already distils it — don't open a doc to re-confirm a rule stated here, or
to answer what a grep answers. Dated files (`*_REVIEW_<date>`, `FINDINGS*`, NEXT_STEPS.md) are
archive. One doc per task, at most; past that, write the code and flag the uncertainty.

## Comments

Say what the code does and why it is the way it is. Do not narrate history — no "this used to",
no "before the promotion", no recounting the bug that prompted the change. Git and the commit
message hold that. A comment longer than the code it explains is almost always history in
disguise. Keep the non-obvious constraint (a wire contract, a RAM ceiling, an ordering that
looks arbitrary and is not); delete the story.

## Status

This section is a terse summary, not the record. Row-level hardware evidence — which board, which
opcode, which date, plaintext vs encrypted, raw vs compressed, happy-path vs negative case — belongs
solely in `docs/HARDWARE_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md`; a bullet here should point at that file's
section rather than restate its detail. If you're about to write more than one sentence of
test-scope narrative in this file, it belongs in the checklist instead.

- **Two broadly hardware-verified targets**: `esp32-idf` (11 board configs, verified on an
  ESP32-S3) and `nordic-zephyr`'s `xiao_nrf52840` board. Everything else — other boards, other
  opcodes, other subsystems — is scoped or open. `docs/HARDWARE_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md` is the
  itemized per-target/per-opcode record; update it alongside this section whenever a hardware
  test runs, and read it (not this file) for row-level evidence.
- **No CI.** `tools/check.sh` (repo root) is the only gate, and nothing runs it but you. Plain
  invocation covers host tests, sanitizers, fuzz targets and the wire corpus; `--targets` adds all
  three target families and is required before merge. A skip is not a pass — read the summary,
  which exits 2 on any skip.
- `targets/esp32-idf/build.sh` builds every board fragment (sources ESP-IDF itself; never on
  `PATH`). `tools/run_host_tests.sh` runs host tests without ESP-IDF.
- `./build-release.sh` (repo root) drives every target's own build entry point, writing
  `release/MANIFEST-<target>.txt` + one top-level summary and a log per target. `--list` prints
  the target table; every target still runs even if an earlier one fails. It does not activate
  any toolchain — export what each target's script expects first (docs/TOOLCHAINS.md).
- **`shared/{core,hal}` implements the whole protocol stack** — dispatch, config, transfer
  (pump/direct/partial/PIPE/NFC), session/crypto, logging, watchdog, advertising, GT911 touch,
  buzzer, config storage — composed per target in named tiers from `shared/sources.cmake` (never
  globbed; that file is the ground truth for which target takes which tier). No promoted
  subsystem has a target-side reimplementation — enforced by the absence ratchets in
  `tools/check.sh` and "The one rule" below. Layering and the `od_hal_*` interface contracts are
  `docs/SHARED_API_DESIGN.md`.
- **Command/dispatch/session/rxq/watchdog/crypto path is shared on ESP32 and Nordic**, both
  hardware-verified for PIPE upload, config read/write and (ESP32 only) `CMD_PARTIAL_WRITE`,
  plaintext and encrypted — checklist has the per-opcode rows. `docs/OD_SESSION.md` is the
  session subsystem reference (wire shapes, KDF, replay window, verification state). Two known
  open risks worth carrying in your head rather than looking up each time: `FOLLOWUPS.md` § 5,
  **bidirectional nonce reuse** (both directions share one session id and start both counters at
  0 — needs a protocol revision, not a firmware fix), and the `OD-S1` PIPE-silence-on-replay path
  is still unproven on any board (checklist § Nordic `xiao_nrf52840`).
- **Transfer plane (pump, direct, partial, PIPE, NFC) is fully shared** across all three targets
  — no target owns wire parsing, chunk assembly, SACK construction or transfer ownership; see
  `docs/DIVERGENCE_MATRIX.md` §§ 3-5, 10 for the wire-visible decisions made while promoting it.
  Per-phase/per-target hardware qualification is itemized and mostly open in the checklist
  (§§ Transfer Phase 1-5). **NFC's hardware gates were waived by project direction**, not passed —
  no board in this fleet has an NFC antenna or a TNB132M fitted, so every `0x0083` row is release
  debt against hardware that doesn't exist here, a stronger form of "open" than the other phases.
- **Shared HALs beyond crypto/session**: time (`od_hal_time`), logging (`od_hal_log`), watchdog,
  advertising, GT911 touch, config storage (`od_config_store` + `od_hal_nvs`), buzzer. All
  implemented on their respective target sets; hardware qualification is itemized per-HAL in the
  checklist and mostly open — touch and buzzer especially, since **no board in this fleet has a
  touch controller fitted** (checklist § Shared GT911 touch driver).
- **Boot-screen key policy** (`od_boot_key_state`) fixed two separable defects — write-ups in
  `docs/DIVERGENCE_MATRIX.md` §§ 26-27 — hardware-verified on ESP32-S3 only, and only for the
  panel key-state lines (checklist § Boot-screen key policy has the exact coverage and gaps,
  including the undecoded QR payload).
- **Never hardware-verified:** the WiFi/LAN transport, and the F4/F7 correctness fixes.
- Arduino shim fully removed from `esp32-idf` (docs/ARCHIVE_esp32_arduino_shim.md);
  `targets/esp32-idf/vendor/fastepd/` is its permanent (non-shim) FastEPD adapter.
- **The wire corpus (`tests/vectors/dispatch.json`) is checked from both ends**:
  `tests/host/corpus_runner.c` drives it through firmware's own `od_dispatch_frame()` (previously
  only py-opendisplay's side was checked), across three target-composition executables with
  different semantic guarantees — see that file's header comments for what each profile does and
  doesn't prove before trusting a pass.
- Live plan: `plans/PLAN_TRANSFER_PHASE45_2026-08-20.md` — complete; its hardware rows are the
  outstanding work, not its steps. Earlier transfer-sequence plans and `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md` are
  superseded/historical.

## The one rule

`shared/` compiles for **every** target: C standard library and `shared/hal` only. **No vendor or
framework header** — `esp_*`, `driver/*`, `soc/*`, `hal/*`, `freertos/*`, `nrf_*`, `nrfx`, `sl_*`,
`em_*`, `zephyr/*`, `Arduino.h`, `bluefruit.h`, `NimBLE*`, `bb_epaper`, `TFT_eSPI`. A file needing
one belongs in `targets/<target>/`. One slip and the repo is four codebases in a directory.
Enforced by the three `shared boundary:` checks in [tools/check.sh](tools/check.sh) — run them
before proposing anything under `shared/`; extend the pattern as targets are imported.

## Architectural decisions

1. **`shared/` is plain C.** Every interface across the boundary is a link-time `extern` C
   function the target implements. No C++ classes, no Arduino `String`.
   Re-argued 2026-08-13 and upheld — but not because C++ is unavailable (all three toolchains
   already compile target `.cpp`). It is that the boundary must be a C API for Zephyr's C
   drivers and the Silabs superloop regardless, and the code being ported is already C in
   `.cpp` files (~20k lines of `targets/esp32-idf/src/` hold 32 `new`, 9 `String`, one class).
   So C++ buys implementation ergonomics only, priced in a doubled host gate, an
   `-fno-exceptions -fno-rtti -fno-threadsafe-statics` contract spread across three build
   systems `shared/` does not own, and an enforcement grep that libstdc++'s transitive
   includes defeat. Three C-side rules buy back most of what RAII and strong types offered:
   - **`_Static_assert` every wire size.** The `sizeof`-derived size table can go silently
     wrong via include order (`shared/sources.cmake`, closing note) — a wrong *value*, not a
     build error. Assert the sizes so it is a build error. Zero cost, C99, unused today.
   - **Non-owning views are `od_span_t`** (`shared/core/od_span.h`), not ptr+len arguments.
     `od_span_split()` is the checked cut and the one place bounds arithmetic is written;
     `take`/`drop` saturate and are only for lengths already known to fit. The whole config
     parse path takes spans; new shared code does too.
   - **Single-exit + `goto cleanup`** in anything holding a resource across a fallible step.
   Revisit only at `od_session.c` / `od_xfer_partial.c`: nested resource
   lifetimes with several failure exits per function are the one shape where manual cleanup
   reliably loses. That is also the last point where switching is cheap.
2. **One vtable, deliberately** — `od_panel_ops` (`targets/esp32-idf/hal/od_hal_panel.h`), for the
   one target with 2-3 panel backends. Keep it the only one.
3. **Three toolchains stay three** (ESP-IDF, west/Zephyr, SLC), all CMake. Unification is about
   shared *source*.
4. **Grouped by silicon vendor, not repo of origin.** nRF52840 is a *board* on `nordic-zephyr`,
   sharing its BT host, PSA Crypto, NVS and panel stack.
5. **No PlatformIO, no Arduino** — no `platformio.ini`, `lib_deps`, Arduino APIs or `build_flags`
   idioms, from any source repo.
6. **BG22 stays on Simplicity SDK.** Zephyr rejected on RAM: 32 KB total, no kernel at all
   (superloop + `sl_power_manager`).
7. **No Kconfig in `shared/`'s config surface** — Silabs lacks it. Plain preprocessor constants;
   Kconfig is only how two targets set them.
8. **No `targets/nrf52-sdk/`.** Legacy nRF52 stays in `Firmware_NRF` and sets the host's compat
   floor (no compression, no `0x76`, no PIPE, no NFC). A dir under `targets/` means "a target this
   repo builds".
9. **No lowest-common-denominator features.** Differences (PSRAM, ROM inflate, panel families,
   PIPE — absent on Silabs) go behind config and `#if`; a target must not pay for a feature it
   lacks.
10. **Import working drivers as-is**; only shared logic is refactored.
11. **First `shared/` source: `shared/core/od_adv_control.c`** (portable BLE advertising/
    lifecycle). `od_config.c` is the first *protocol* subsystem promoted.
12. **`OD_CONFIG_MAX_SIZE` is 4096 — except BG22, which is 2048** (C13, 2026-08-17). It was a
    global cap for exactly the right reason: a per-target limit is a wire divergence a host
    **cannot interrogate**, and `MAX_CONFIG_SIZE` was dropped from the capability bytes *because*
    the value had become uniform. That reason has not gone away; it was outweighed on a 32 KB
    part, where 4096 costs +2 KB of NVM3 record against a ~10.5 KB heap. So the constant is now
    `#ifndef`-guarded in `od_config_asm.h` and set per target — 4096 on ESP32 and Nordic, 2048 on
    BG22 via `target_compile_definitions`.
    **Two things make that safe, and neither is optional.** `od_config_asm_start()` bounds the
    declared total against `OD_CONFIG_MAX_SIZE` as well as the 4,000-byte transferable ceiling —
    without it any cap below 4,000 is a remotely triggerable buffer overflow from a two-byte
    length field, which is what the pre-C13 code was one constant away from. And BG22 **refuses,
    never truncates**: an oversize declaration is NACKed at the start frame with nothing stored.
    Silent truncation is the exact failure the fleet-wide rule existed to prevent, and it is
    invisible to the host.
    `struct od_config_asm` changes size with this macro, so any host test or target build mixing
    caps across translation units is an ABI mismatch — `tests/host/` compiles a separate
    `od_shared_silabs` for this reason.
13. **`third_party/` is exempt from the one rule** — `bb_epaper` picks its IO backend by `#ifdef`.
    Still one vendored copy for all targets; do not move it into `shared/`.
14. **Headers beat design docs.** Where `targets/esp32-idf/hal/*.h` and docs/SHARED_API_DESIGN.md
    disagree, fix the doc.
15. **`OD_COLOR_SCHEME_GRAY8` is a reserved identity, not an implemented scheme** (C-color,
    2026-08-18). `shared/core/od_color.h` squats value 9 behind an `#ifndef` so a future canonical
    assignment syncs down without renumbering, and `od_color_direct_geometry()` returns
    `OD_COLOR_UNSUPPORTED` for it. Do not add 3-bpp packing, a 4-bpp substitute, FastEPD
    expansion, Inkplate waveform selection, target admission, or a boot fallback — every
    operational display path rejects it explicitly, and `tests/host/color_test.c` static-asserts
    the number.
    When `../opendisplay-protocol` eventually reserves value 9 and the vendored header is synced,
    remove the `#ifndef` fallback and update `epaper-dithering`'s parity exemptions as external
    follow-up work. **That enum reservation alone does not authorize wire behavior:**
    `py-opendisplay` must keep rejecting uploads, and firmware must keep rejecting operational
    use, until a separate device-qualified protocol/backend plan defines and tests the encoding.
    See `plans/PLAN_OD_COLOR_2026-08-18.md` § 2.1.

## Layout

`shared/{protocol,core,compress,hal}` — wire contract / dispatch + config + transfer + auth /
inflate engines / interfaces targets implement.
`targets/{esp32-idf,nordic-zephyr,efr32bg22-slc}` — chip drivers + build system + HAL impl.
`third_party/` vendored cross-target libs (bb_epaper); `tools/`; `docs/`.

## Toolchains

Installed, but **none on `PATH`** — `which idf.py west` returning nothing ≠ absent.

| Toolchain | Version | Activate with |
|---|---|---|
| ESP-IDF | v5.5.4 | `source ~/esp/esp-idf/export.sh` |
| nRF Connect SDK / west | v3.3.1 / west v1.5.0 | `nrfutil toolchain-manager launch --ncs-version v3.3.1 -- <cmd>` |
| Simplicity SDK | 2025.12.2 | `slt`; `slc` also needs the bundled Java on `PATH` |

Pin one ESP-IDF release; floors ≥ 5.1 (C6), ≥ 5.2 (`driver/i2c_master.h` — not the deprecated
`driver/i2c.h`). Only ESP-IDF has built anything here. **Do not claim a build passes without
running it.** docs/TOOLCHAINS.md has the version pins and the Arduino-API replacement census.

## Protocol header — do not hand-edit

`shared/protocol/opendisplay_protocol.h` and `opendisplay_structs.h` are byte-for-byte copies of
`../opendisplay-protocol`. Edit the canonical file there, never these.

## Migration constraints

Rationale in [docs/MIGRATION.md](docs/MIGRATION.md) / [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
— open only if a change contradicts a rule here or adds a target.

- **One target at a time:** `esp32-idf` → `nordic-zephyr` (nRF54L15) → `efr32bg22-slc` →
  `nordic-zephyr` (nRF52840). ESP32 first as the reference for `shared/core`; Silabs third so its
  32 KB / no-kernel / no-Kconfig limits bite before other targets bake in assumptions.
- **Import unchanged in one commit**, then fix only include paths and build files; record source
  repo + SHA. Exceptions: the ESP32 framework change, and Silabs' 57 MB vendored SDK.
- **One subsystem per swap**, build + flash + hardware verify between each, independently
  revertable.
- **Delete nothing from the original repos** until the unified target is hardware-verified.
- **Resolve divergence deliberately and write it down** — not by whichever repo was copied first.
  **`Firmware` is the authority over `Firmware_NRF54`** when their algorithms disagree: it is the
  field-proven original and what the host tooling was validated against, and the NRF54 port
  re-derived several of them. So port the `esp32-idf` behaviour and make the Zephyr difference
  justify itself — in a differential test, the Firmware form is the reference. `esp32-idf` is
  C++ and `shared/` is plain C, so this usually means a C port, not a file move. A default, not
  a licence to skip the write-up.
- **THE AUTHORITY IS `../Firmware/`, THE SIBLING REPO — NOT `targets/esp32-idf/src/`.** That
  directory is a *snapshot* taken at import, and upstream keeps moving. Before porting or
  transcribing any algorithm, diff the two; when this repo and upstream disagree, upstream wins
  unless the difference is a deliberate Firmware_Unified adaptation (Arduino removal, `od_hal_*`,
  `od_log`, `struct od_config`), which the import is full of — so separate *drift* from
  *adaptation* rather than blanket-copying either way. `../Firmware/tools/` also carries host
  tests worth porting with the code they cover.
  Learned the hard way on `od_session` (2026-08-15): the replay window had been extracted upstream
  into `src/nonce_window.h` with an 816-line host test, and three rounds of design were built on
  the stale ring instead — two of them wrong in security-relevant ways (a forward window cap that
  strands a session, and counting nonce failures as integrity strikes so packet loss tears one
  down). A 30-second diff would have caught all of it.
  The same applies to the other three source repos for their targets.

## Memory sensitivity

EFR32BG22 32 KB, nRF52840 256 KB, ESP32-S3 512 KB + PSRAM. `shared/` must avoid buffers sized for
the biggest target, unbounded heap, and assuming a heap exists. Sizes go behind compile-time
constants the target sets, with a documented floor — `OD_CONFIG_MAX_SIZE` included since C13
(decision 12), so there is no longer an exception to this rule. Its floor is a 400-byte policy
assert in `od_config_asm.h`, and a cap a host cannot query has to be **refused loudly** rather
than silently truncated (docs/MEMORY_CONSTRAINTS.md item 3, `DIVERGENCE_MATRIX` 2.7).
