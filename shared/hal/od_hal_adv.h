/* od_hal_adv.h -- the advertising HAL every target implements.
 *
 * Three link-time C functions, not a vtable: shared/ is plain C and binds to the target
 * implementation at link time (CLAUDE.md § "The one rule"). The single deliberate
 * function-pointer exception in this tree is od_panel_ops, and this is not it.
 *
 * THE DIVISION OF LABOUR. The target owns AD-record packing and the stack calls, because
 * PDU layout and update APIs differ across NimBLE, Bluefruit, Zephyr and BGAPI. The shared
 * controller (od_adv_control.h) owns *when* those calls happen. Nothing here decides policy.
 *
 * CONTEXT. Every one of these is called from the application loop, never from a stack
 * callback. That is the whole point of F4: callbacks publish facts, the loop acts on them.
