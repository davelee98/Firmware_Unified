/* od_hal_radio.h -- the transport a queued response leaves through.
 *
 * The fourth shared HAL, after od_hal_adv, od_hal_wdt and od_hal_crypto. Division of labour: this
 * header owns nothing but the act of handing bytes to a link and asking whether that link is still
 * the one that asked. Queue policy, reservation, sealing and drain ordering are od_txq's; framing
 * is od_session's; who may talk is the target's connection policy.
 *
 * NOT ISR-SAFE, and not intended to be. Every caller runs on the single loop/main context that
 * owns the queue, the same contract od_adv_control and od_session already state.
