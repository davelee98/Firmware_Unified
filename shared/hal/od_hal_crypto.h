/* od_hal_crypto.h -- the cryptography HAL every session-capable target implements.
 *
 * Link-time C functions, not a vtable: shared/ is plain C and binds to the target
 * implementation at link time (CLAUDE.md section "The one rule"). od_panel_ops is the single
 * deliberate function-pointer exception in this tree, and this is not it.
 *
 * THE DIVISION OF LABOUR. The target owns its cryptographic engine, vendor key handles,
 * prepared-key storage and error logging. Shared session code owns the handshake, KDF inputs,
 * nonce construction, replay policy and integrity-strike policy. Vendor status values never
 * cross this boundary; the four-valued result preserves the policy distinctions shared/ needs.
 *
 * CONTEXT. Every function here is called from the dispatch pump, never from an ISR or stack
 * callback. The target may therefore use the synchronous form of its crypto API. Every entry
 * point self-initialises its backend idempotently; there is no separate init call and no required
 * ordering. In particular, random and CMAC must work before any prepared slot has been set.
