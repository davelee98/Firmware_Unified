/* od_hal_wdt.h -- the watchdog HAL every target implements.
 *
 * Link-time C functions, not a vtable: shared/ is plain C and binds to the target
 * implementation at link time (CLAUDE.md § "The one rule"). od_panel_ops is the single
 * deliberate function-pointer exception in this tree, and this is not it.
 *
 * THE DIVISION OF LABOUR. The target owns the peripheral, the retained-memory backing store,
 * and the chip's reset-cause register. The shared controller (od_watchdog.h) owns the POLICY
 * built on top of them: strike counting, safe mode, the retained-byte layout, and breadcrumb
 * change detection. Nothing here decides policy; nothing in od_watchdog.c names a register.
 *
 * MODELLED ON A WORKING IMPLEMENTATION, NOT DESIGNED FROM SCRATCH. Every function below exists
 * because Firmware/src/watchdog_nrf.cpp needed it on real hardware. That file is 413 lines, of
 * which roughly a third is portable policy that had no home; this HAL is the seam that lets the
 * policy move here and the register work stay in targets/.
 *
 * CONTEXT. Every function here is called from the application loop or from boot, never from an
 * ISR. See od_watchdog_feed()'s contract: an interrupt-fed watchdog proves the interrupt
 * controller is running, not the program, which is the classic way to build a watchdog that
 * never fires.

 *
 * A bitmask rather than an enum because that is what the hardware gives: nRF52840's RESETREAS
 * latches every cause independently, and an implementation that reported only the first match
 * would hide a watchdog reset behind a coincident pin reset. Firmware/src/watchdog_nrf.cpp
 * learned this the expensive way -- an earlier revision omitted three causes and printed them
 * all as POWERON, because its fallback keyed on "nothing matched" instead of on r == 0.
 *
 * POWER_ON IS AN EXPLICIT BIT, not the zero value. On nRF a cold start latches nothing, so the
 * target maps 0 to this bit; ESP-IDF reports ESP_RST_POWERON directly. Making it explicit means
 * OD_HAL_WDT_RESET_UNKNOWN keeps its own distinct meaning -- "the target could not tell" -- and
 * a caller never has to guess which of the two an all-zero word meant.

 * is no second byte to be had there. Targets with more retained space (ESP32 RTC slow memory,
 * Zephyr retained_mem) must not widen this: the layout in od_watchdog.h packs a validity tag,
 * a strike count and a breadcrumb phase into these 8 bits, and a target-specific widening would
 * make the retained state mean different things on different boards.
 *
 * Both accessors report failure rather than swallowing it. A silently dead breadcrumb is worse
 * than no breadcrumb, because the boot log still prints a phase -- a stale or zero one -- and
 * invites a confident wrong conclusion about where the firmware wedged.
 *
 * A target with no retained memory at all returns false from both. The policy layer degrades to
 * "no breadcrumb, no strike counting" and says so, rather than pretending.

 * would inherit a live watchdog it never feeds and reset forever until someone physically
 * removes power. That is a brick. An implementation must detect a running watchdog and feed it
