# Per-target compile-time profile for shared/ — ONE definition, every consumer.
#
# These macros change the ABI of shared structures: OD_CONFIG_WITH_* #if-gate members of
# struct od_config, OD_CONFIG_MAX_SIZE sizes struct od_config_asm, and OD_TXQ_SLOTS and the
# OD_CAP_* switches size or remove state. A host archive built with a different set is a
# different layout, so a suite compiled that way validates something the firmware does not run —
# it passes, and proves nothing.
#
# So the firmware build and every host archive that claims to represent a target read the list
# from here. A consumer adds only definitions that are genuinely its own (a test-only knob, a
# board flag); it never restates one of these.
#
# Included by shared/sources.cmake, so anything already consuming the source list has these.

# EFR32BG22: 32 KB RAM, no kernel, no PIPE, no partial transfer, no RX ring, single chip select,
# no logging, and no touch/buzzer/Wi-Fi/extended-data hardware.

# OD_LOG_LEVEL=OD_LOG_DEBUG straight into OD_BOARD_DEFINES and ordinary boards fell through to
# od_log.h's INFO default, while Nordic turned PROFILE=debug into OD_DEBUG_BUILD and then named
# OD_LOG_LEVEL itself. Two directives that agree today drift independently, so the mapping from
# a profile name to the definition lives here and the front doors only supply the name.

# two of them is a silent precedence question at the compiler, which is the drift this exists to

# spelling the compiler would honour, including one nested in a generator expression, plus a
# leading -D and a bare valueless OD_LOG_LEVEL. The latter becomes 1 (OD_LOG_WARN), so it builds
# clean and silently drops every info and debug record.
