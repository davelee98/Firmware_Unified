/* od_config_asm.h -- chunked CONFIG_WRITE reassembly, shared by every target.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO FIX (correctness review F3). The ESP32 implementation treated any
 * payload over 200 bytes as chunked, never checked the declared total against what actually
 * arrived, and committed on a CHUNK COUNT rather than a byte count. Four consequences, all
 * reachable from a malformed client:
 *
 *   - a 201-byte start was ACKed as an active one-chunk transfer and never saved;
 *   - a start frame longer than 202 bytes silently discarded the excess;
 *   - a declared total of 201 followed by a 200-byte continuation committed 400 bytes,
 *     because the chunk count reached the expected two; and
 *   - a declared total above MAX_CONFIG_SIZE was not rejected at the start, so the transfer
 *     failed later for an indirect reason.
 *
 * The third is the one that matters: a byte sequence inconsistent with its own declared length
 * was written to NVS. Even where downstream CRC parsing rejects it, storage has already
 * changed -- and on a device with encryption disabled the config-write path has no
 * authentication gate at all, so any client that can connect can reach it.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE TOUCHES NO STORAGE. Reassembly reports a result; the caller saves. That is
 * not tidiness -- it is what makes "never alter storage on a rejected sequence" structural
 * rather than a rule someone has to remember at three call sites. There is no NVS symbol here
 * to misuse.
 *
 * Plain C99, no allocation, no blocking, one static buffer. Single-context: the caller owns
 * the struct and must not drive it from two tasks.

 * plain `#define MAX_CONFIG_SIZE 4096` inside targets/esp32-idf/src/config_parser.h, i.e. a
 * per-target macro that every target happens to spell the same way. A value described as

 * would detect the divergence.
 *
 * It belongs in shared/protocol/opendisplay_protocol.h. Adding it is blocked on the header
 * freeze, so it is FLAGGED here rather than quietly duplicated: this header defines its own
 * name, and each target asserts the two agree at the point where both are visible (see
 * targets/esp32-idf/src/config_parser.h). A mismatch is then a compile error in the target
 * that introduced it, not a silently smaller buffer.
