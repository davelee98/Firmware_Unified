/* od_txq.h -- the response queue, its capacity reservation, and the drain.
 *
 * WHY A RESERVATION EXISTS AT ALL. Handlers mutate state before they reply: a config write commits
 * to storage and then acks. If the queue is full at ack time the device has done the work and the
 * host is never told, which is indistinguishable from the work not happening. So capacity is
 * claimed BEFORE the handler runs, and a handler that cannot be answered is never invoked.
 *
 * WHY A COUNTER AND NOT RESERVED SLOTS. A reserved-but-unwritten slot is a hole in a FIFO, and the
 * pre-refresh flush would stall on it -- exactly the failure the barrier exists to prevent, since
 * a 0x72 END holds its reservation across a refresh that can take a minute. A counter has no
 * holes. The cost is one memcpy of the finished frame instead of composing in place.
 *
 * WHY A TOKEN AND NOT A BARE COUNTER. Ownership. A config producer and an incoming command can
 * both be mid-flight across loop passes, and "some reply consumed a unit" is not the same as "THIS
 * reply consumed one of ITS units". The token makes borrowing another frame's capacity an
 * invariant failure rather than an accident that shows up as a lost ack under load.
 *
 * CONTEXT: single loop/main task, like od_adv_control and od_session. No locks. The token supplies
 * the ownership a bare global counter did not; it does not make this reentrant.
