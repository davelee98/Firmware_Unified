/* od_rxq_app.h -- the two per-target facts the shared RX arrival line needs.
 *
 * The line itself lives in od_rxq.c, one text for every target. These two predicates do not,
 * because neither can be answered from the ring:
 *
 *   - whether session encryption is configured, which decides the ERX/URX token. ESP32 answers
 *     from its own encryption state and Nordic from its parsed security config; there is no
 *     shared symbol that means the same thing on both.
 *   - whether this opcode's per-frame line should be suppressed, which depends on transfer state
 *     that od_xfer.c owns. Once the transfer logging converges this can become one shared
 *     implementation and these predicates can go.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT ROUTED THROUGH od_session_app.h. APP_RXQ is an independently selectable
 * source tier (shared/sources.cmake); calling the session seam from od_rxq.c would make it
 * depend on APP_SESSION without saying so. A target that takes APP_RXQ implements these two.
 *
 * BOTH ARE CALLED FROM THE STACK CALLBACK TASK, so neither may block, take a lock the loop
 * holds, or dispatch.
 *
 * ONLY REFERENCED IN A BUILD COMPILED AT OD_LOG_DEBUG -- the arrival line is debug-gated, and at
 * INFO the whole block including these calls is preprocessed away. tests/host's rxq seam fixture
 * is built at DEBUG for exactly that reason: at INFO a missing implementation links fine.
