/* od_config_store -- the stored config record: framing, CRC and bounds, once.
 *
 * All three targets already agreed on the record byte-for-byte -- 0xDEADBEEF, version 1, a
 * CRC-32 over the payload, a 16-byte little-endian header -- and each carried its own copy of
 * the code that writes and checks it. This is that code. What is below it, the medium, is
 * shared/hal/od_hal_nvs.h; what is above it, the parse, is od_config.
 *
 * On-medium layout, unchanged and not this module's to change:
 *
 *     offset 0   magic     u32  0xDEADBEEF
 *     offset 4   version   u32  written as 1, CARRIED AND NOT CHECKED (see below)
 *     offset 8   crc       u32  CRC-32 of the payload only
 *     offset 12  data_len  u32  payload length
 *     offset 16  payload   data_len bytes
 *
 * THE WORKSPACE IS THE CALLER'S. od_config_store_save() fills a contiguous span the caller
 * owns -- header at offset 0, payload at offset 16 -- and hands the whole span to the HAL in
 * one write. BG22 points that at a union with its config assembler, which is why it needs no
 * staging buffer on a 32 KB part; the other two point it at the one they already keep. If the
 * payload already sits at offset 16 it is not copied over itself.
 *
 * VERSION IS RESERVED, NOT ENFORCED. Every target writes 1 and none has ever read it back.
 * Checking it here would be a new rejection wearing a refactor's clothes: a device holding a
 * record this firmware did not write would stop booting on its stored config. If the field is
 * ever to mean something, that is a deliberate change with a compatibility story and a
 * DIVERGENCE_MATRIX row.
