/* od_advert.h -- the 16-byte OpenDisplay manufacturer-specific data, encoded once.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. od_adv_control decides WHEN to advertise (start, stop, restart, the
 * post-disconnect settle). This decides WHAT the 16 bytes SAY. The two are deliberately
 * separate modules with adjacent names because they have unrelated failure modes: getting
 * od_adv_control wrong makes a device unreachable, getting this wrong makes every host
 * misread a temperature. Neither one calls the other.
 *
 * WHY IT IS WORTH PROMOTING. Three targets encode this same wire structure three different
 * ways today:
 *
 *   targets/esp32-idf/src/display_service.cpp:1886   struct MsdAdvertisement + memcpy, the
 *                                                    OD_MSD_STATUS_* macros, and a hardcoded
 *                                                    company id literal 0x2446
 *   targets/nordic-zephyr/src/opendisplay_ble.c:400  bytes placed at [0][1][2][13][14][15] by
 *                                                    hand, status bits open-coded, with a
 *                                                    comment citing the ESP32's line numbers
 *                                                    as the specification
 *   targets/efr32bg22-slc/opendisplay_ble.c:1678     the same byte-offset form again
 *
 * A comment that points at another target's line numbers IS a shared module -- just one the
 * compiler cannot check. The (t + 40) * 2 temperature encoding and the 511 cap on the 10-bit
 * battery field are written out three times each; they agree today, which is luck rather than
 * structure, since nothing fails when a fourth target or an edit makes them disagree.
 *
 * NO HAL. Inputs are five scalars and an 11-byte block the caller already owns; the output is
 * 16 bytes into the caller's buffer. No allocation, no clock, no storage, no logging -- this
 * is the PURE tier, so every target can take it the day it lands rather than when some HAL
 * arrives. Sensor acquisition, the caching that feeds it, and the publish call all stay in the
 * target where the vendor APIs are.
 *
 * ENDIANNESS IS EXPLICIT. The bytes are written one at a time, little-endian, not by memcpy of
 * a packed struct -- shared/ compiles for three toolchains and must not inherit a host's byte
 * order. The compile-time offsetof checks in od_advert.c tie those explicit writes back to the
 * canonical struct MsdAdvertisement, so a layout change in the protocol header breaks the
 * build here instead of silently changing what goes out over the air.
