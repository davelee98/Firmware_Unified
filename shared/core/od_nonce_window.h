/* od_nonce_window.h -- VERBATIM PORT of ../Firmware/src/nonce_window.h @ 64184bb.
 *
 * The ONLY edits are this banner, the include guard, and ONE typedef marked C99 ADAPTATION below
 * (upstream is C++, where a bare enum tag is already a type). Everything else is byte-identical
 * to upstream, deliberately, so pulling a future upstream fix is a copy rather than a merge. Do
 * not reformat it, do not od_-prefix the enum, and do not "improve" the arithmetic -- CLAUDE.md's
 * migration rule is to import working code unchanged.
 *
 * WHY IT IS PORTED RATHER THAN WRITTEN. This repo's targets/esp32-idf/src/encryption.cpp carries
 * an older +-32 signed-difference window. Upstream replaced it, and an od_session design that
 * re-derived one instead of porting this got two things wrong in security-relevant ways: it
 * bounded the FORWARD direction (which strands a session once a gap exceeds the cap, since
 * nothing then commits and last_seen never advances), and it used signed differences on a counter
 * an attacker controls before the tag is verified (three routes to UB). Both are argued out in
 * the comments below.
 *
 * Its 816-line host test lives at ../Firmware/tools/test_nonce_window.cpp and is the differential
 * oracle for tests/host/session_test.c.
 *
 * shared/ boundary: this file includes only stdbool/stdint/string.h and touches no global state,
 * which is what let it move without change.

// Anti-replay sliding window — pure state machine, ZERO dependencies.
//
// This header deliberately includes nothing from Arduino, mbedtls, or the
// firmware logging layer, and it touches no global state. Everything here
// operates on plain values passed in by the caller, so the whole state machine
// can be compiled and exercised on a host under UBSan/ASan by
// tools/test_nonce_window.cpp. See Decision D in
// docs/PLAN_PHASE1_NONCE_REPLAY_2026-07-26.md.
//
// Representation ("shifting" style, as opposed to the circular RFC 6479 /
// WireGuard style -- Decision B in docs/PLAN_PHASE1_NONCE_REPLAY_2026-07-26.md,
// which still stands; only the arithmetic over it moved from modular to numeric):
//
//   bit i of the bitmap == "counter (last_seen - i) has been consumed".
//   bit 0 is last_seen itself.
//
// The backward window is therefore implicitly OD_NONCE_BACKWARD_BITS - 1; there
// is no separate window constant to keep in step, and no insertion index to
// reset. "Not seen" is a clear bit rather than a reserved sentinel value, so a
// fresh session (last_seen = 0, all-zero bitmap) accepts counter 0 exactly once
// with no has_seen_counter flag.
//
// --- relationship to RFC 4303 -----------------------------------------------
//
// The decision rule is RFC 4303 Appendix A2's anti-replay window, and the three
// cases map one-to-one: right of the window -> authenticate, then slide (clearing
// wholesale when the jump exceeds the width); inside the window -> consult the
// bitmap; left of the window -> discard. So does the ordering that makes it safe,
// "if the MAC is valid, the window is updated" — here od_nonce_check() decides,
// CCM verifies, and only then does od_nonce_commit() run.
//
// Three deliberate departures, none of them semantic:
//
//   - Counters are 0-based. RFC 4303 §3.3.3 starts sequence numbers at 1; this
//     protocol's client sends counter 0 as its first command, so a 1-based rule
//     would reject every client's first frame.
//   - The full 64-bit counter is on the wire, so there is no ESN high-order-bit
//     inference to do. That machinery would be complexity with no function.
//   - The window is 256 bits rather than the RFC's 32 minimum / 64 default,
//     which §3.4.3 explicitly permits.
//
// Following §3.3.3, the counter does NOT wrap: it is treated as a plain
// monotonically increasing uint64_t, and a session that reached UINT64_MAX would
// have to re-authenticate rather than cycle. Wrapping would reuse a (key, nonce)
// pair, which is the precise CCM failure this file exists to prevent. Exhausting
// 2^64 counters inside one session is not reachable in practice.

#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <string.h>

// Width of the backward (out-of-order / duplicate arrival) window, in bits.
// uint64_t[4] = 32 B.
//
// This width is ONLY reordering tolerance. Replay protection does not depend on
// it: a counter at or below last_seen is either caught by the bitmap (within the
// width) or rejected on width, and only counters above last_seen are ever
// accepted — and those, by the monotonicity argument on od_nonce_check(), were
// never consumed. Narrowing or widening it cannot create a replay hole.
//
// Nor is it a correctness cliff, because a backward rejection is self-healing:
// the client re-encrypts every retransmission with a fresh, HIGHER counter (it
// never resends the original ciphertext), and a higher counter is accepted
// unconditionally. A frame rejected here is re-sent under a counter that is not.
//
// So the exact value is not load-bearing, and there is deliberately no attempt to
// derive it from the client's pipe window, blocks_per_ack or retransmit budget —
// none of those bear on it. 256 is a generous margin over the zero reordering the
// transport actually produces (the client assigns counters synchronously
// immediately before each write, ATT preserves order, and both targets consume
// their RX rings FIFO), at a cost of 32 bytes per session.

// Pure: decides whether `counter` may be accepted. Writes nothing.
//
// There is NO forward bound, and its absence is the point. A counter above
// last_seen is accepted at any distance, exactly as RFC 4303 does, because the
// sender may legitimately have burned counters this receiver never saw — every
// PIPE retransmission spends a fresh one. A forward cap here would not bound an
// attacker (see the commit contract below: passing this check mutates nothing,
// and only a verified CCM tag commits), but it WOULD strand the session: once a
// gap exceeded the cap, nothing would commit, last_seen would never advance, and
// every subsequent frame — each carrying a still higher counter — would be
// rejected further out than the last, until re-authentication.
//
// This reverses Decision A of docs/PLAN_PHASE1_NONCE_REPLAY_2026-07-26.md, which
// specified a cap of 128; that file's "Reversal of Decision A" section carries the
// full argument and the arithmetic showing no cap could have been sized safely.
//
// The security invariant is "a consumed counter is never returned NONCE_OK
// again", and it rests on last_seen being monotonically non-decreasing: only the
// forward branch of od_nonce_commit() assigns it, and only upward. Every consumed
// counter is therefore <= last_seen forever, so the `counter > last_seen` arm
// cannot re-accept one. Below that, a consumed counter is bitmap-caught while it
// is represented and rejected on width once it is not — the region below the
// window is closed, never waved through.
//
// Comparison is plain numeric, NOT modular. Modular arithmetic makes a counter
// far behind indistinguishable from one far ahead (the two differences are
// complements mod 2^64), which is what allowed an ancient counter to present as
// an enormous forward jump. Numeric ordering removes that overlap structurally
// rather than relying on the caller to check before committing. For the same
// reason, do not reintroduce a bound by setting a cap to UINT64_MAX or by
// treating "not within the backward window" as forward — either restores the
// overlap this ordering exists to eliminate.
//
// Total over all 2^64 inputs and never UB: the counter is parsed off the wire
// BEFORE the CCM tag is verified, so an unauthenticated attacker controls both
// operands. Only unsigned comparison and one unsigned subtraction are used, and
// that subtraction is evaluated solely on the branch where counter < last_seen,
// so it cannot wrap. Converting a uint64_t >= 2^63 to int64_t is
// implementation-defined before C++20, the signed subtraction can overflow, and
// negating INT64_MIN is UB — three ways to be undefined on attacker-chosen input,
// all avoided.
