 *    exclusive link forever.
 *  - UNKNOWN is separate from NACK because an unrecognised opcode must not be ACTIVITY. Folded
 *    into either of the others, unknown-command traffic would refresh the owner's idle clock and
 *    keep the exclusive link alive indefinitely. */

 * auth-abuse run. The distinctions are load-bearing, not cosmetic:
 *
 *  - AUTH_CONTROL and DISCOVERY exist because a handshake or a version poll must NOT stamp
 *    activity. Treating either as ACCEPTED lets a discovery poll hold the exclusive link forever.
 *  - AUTH_ESTABLISHED is separate again: it resets the abuse run but still does not stamp.
 *  - AUTH_REQUIRED and CRYPTO_FAILED are separate because only the first advances the abuse run.
 *    od_session already counts a bad tag toward its own three-strike rule; dispatch must not add
 *    a second strike for the same frame.
 *  - CRYPTO_DROPPED is the deliberate silence: a replayed or out-of-window PIPE data frame is
 *    ordinary packet loss, and answering it with a fatal NACK kills the upload.
