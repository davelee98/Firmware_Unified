/* Shared SHT40 driver: device policy, not just conversion.
 *
 * It owns the config walk, address candidates and probing, the soft reset, the measurement
 * sequence and its retry policy, both CRC-8 checks, the conversion and clamps, the poll TTL and
 * the MSD packing. What it does NOT own is the bus (shared/hal/od_hal_i2c.h) and the three things
 * in od_sensor_app.h.
 *
 * MULTI-INSTANCE. Every SensorData entry of type SHT40 is walked, because both ports already
 * supported more than one and collapsing that to "the first" would be a silent capability loss.
 * (BQ27220 is the opposite and takes the first match only -- see od_sensor_bq27220.h.)
 *
 * `cfg` is not retained after return. Both ports kept their TTL and cache statics across an init
 * call, so this does too rather than silently making a config reload a state reset.
