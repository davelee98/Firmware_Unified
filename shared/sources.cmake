# shared/sources.cmake — the single source list for shared/.
#
# Four consumers include this file:
#
#   targets/esp32-idf/       idf_component_register(SRCS ${OD_SHARED_SOURCES} ...)
#   targets/nordic-zephyr/   target_sources(app PRIVATE ${OD_SHARED_SOURCES})
#   targets/efr32bg22-slc/   cmake_gcc/opendisplay-bg22.cmake's source set (NOT the .slcp: shared/
#                            sits outside the SLC project dir, same as third_party/, so it is
#                            hand-maintained there like every other out-of-tree source)
#   tests/host/              the host unit-test build
#
# One list, four consumers, so a file added to shared/ that is not tested is a build
# error in three places rather than an omission nobody notices. That is the whole point
# of the file existing instead of each build globbing — do not replace this with a GLOB.
#
# Paths are relative to this file's directory. Consumers prefix with ${OD_SHARED_DIR}.
#
# HEADER-ONLY FILES HAVE NO ENTRY HERE and that is not the omission this file exists to prevent.
# core/od_span.h and core/od_nonce_window.h are the two today: both are all static inline, so
# there is nothing to compile separately and nothing to link. They still reach every consumer,
# because every one of them takes OD_SHARED_INCLUDE_DIRS and the sources below include them. Do
# not "fix" their absence by inventing an od_span.c -- what the one-list rule guards against is a
# source no target builds, and a header with no source cannot be that.
#
# The list is no longer empty. core/od_adv_control.c is the first entry, landed with its host
# tests (tests/host/adv_control_test.c), which were written against the header before the
# implementation existed.
#
# WHY THE ADVERTISING CONTROLLER AND NOT THE CONFIG PARSER. Decided 2026-08-05
# (docs/NEXT_STEPS_2026-08-05.md D1, docs/F4_PORTABLE_BLE_LIFECYCLE_PLAN.md): it has no wire
# surface and no vendor coupling, so it establishes the shared-source build and test pattern
# without moving protocol state. It is a narrow infrastructure exception, NOT a reordering of
# the subsystem sequence below — od_config.c is still the first subsystem that parses, stores,
# or alters wire behaviour, and its pre-auth-attack-surface rationale is untouched.
#
# Order of arrival, per docs/MIGRATION.md § "Per-target procedure" step 4:
#   core/od_adv_control.c advertising/lifecycle policy          (LANDED — no wire surface)
#   core/od_config_asm.c  chunked CONFIG_WRITE reassembly        (LANDED — closes F3)
#   core/od_config_tlv.c  config blob walk + CRC                 (LANDED — pre-auth surface)
#   core/od_config.c      the parsed aggregate: instance caps,   (LANDED — the storage half of
#                         zero-key rule, string termination       the parser, downstream of the
#                                                                 walk. Firmware is the authority
#                                                                 per CLAUDE.md; its zero-key
#                                                                 normalisation is promoted and
#                                                                 the other two targets' lack of
#                                                                 it is the divergence settled.)
#   core/od_watchdog.c    strike/safe-mode/breadcrumb policy     (LANDED — called on
#                         esp32-idf and nordic-zephyr, which implement hal/od_hal_wdt.h over the
#                         Task Watchdog and the devicetree watchdog0/gpregret2 nodes
#                         respectively. efr32bg22-slc does not implement it and does not take
#                         this tier. Policy landed before either HAL because it must behave
#                         identically on four chips and is cheap to get wrong in a way only a
#                         field boot-loop reveals. Like od_adv_control.c this has no wire
#                         surface, so it is not a reordering of the protocol subsystem
#                         sequence below.)
#   core/od_advert.c      16-byte MSD build                   (LANDED — moved AHEAD of the
#                         protocol subsystems below, deliberately. It was the only remaining
#                         item needing no HAL and no state machine, so every target can take it
#                         the day it lands, and it changes wire ENCODING only — the same bytes
#                         three targets already broadcast, now pinned by a differential host
#                         test instead of by a comment citing another target's line numbers.
#                         Not a reordering of anything that parses or alters wire BEHAVIOUR.)
#   core/od_session.c     auth, KDF, nonce/replay              (LANDED — moved AHEAD of
#                         od_dispatch.c, deliberately. The dispatcher's own encryption gate is
#                         written in terms of this module: it asks od_session_security_enabled()
#                         and od_session_alive() before routing, and calls od_session_open() /
#                         od_session_seal() around every handler. Landing dispatch first would
#                         mean writing that gate against three targets' private session state and
#                         then rewriting it, so the ordering is a dependency, not a preference.)
#   core/od_txq.c         response queue, reservation, drain   (LANDED — egress before dispatch,
#                         because the dispatcher reserves capacity BEFORE it calls a handler and
#                         cannot be written against a queue that does not exist yet. No wire
#                         surface of its own: it moves finished frames, it does not build them.)
#   core/od_dispatch.c    opcode dispatch, encryption gate
#   core/od_xfer_direct.c 0x70/0x71/0x72
#   core/od_xfer_partial.c 0x76
#   core/od_pipe.c        0x80-0x82          (compile-gated OD_PIPE_ENABLE)
#   core/od_zlib_inflate.c portable streaming zlib inflate     (LANDED — one bounded static
#                         window, shared by all three target families; ESP32 may remap the API
#                         to its ROM-backed tinfl adapter without changing the wire contract.)
#   core/od_color.c       direct-stream color geometry          (LANDED — stateless checked
#                         geometry shared by all three target families; GRAY8 value 9 remains an
#                         explicitly unsupported local placeholder with no wire representation.)

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- source tiers ---
#
# The tiers answer ONE question: what must a consumer already have in order to link this source?
# They are NOT a second dimension of policy and NOT a way to opt out of shared code.
#
#   PURE     needs the C standard library and shared/protocol only. Any consumer can take it.
#   HAL_ADV  needs shared/hal/od_hal_adv.h implemented (three link-time C functions).
#   HAL_CRYPTO needs shared/hal/od_hal_crypto.h implemented (prepared AES key + primitives).
#   HAL_WDT  needs shared/hal/od_hal_wdt.h implemented (reset reason, retained byte, arm, feed).
#   HAL_RADIO needs shared/hal/od_hal_radio.h implemented (send one frame, is this tag live).
#
# WHY THE SPLIT EXISTS. A target part-way through migration can consume the sources whose HAL it
# has and add the rest as each HAL lands, instead of waiting to take all of shared/ at once. That
# is a real state — targets/nordic-zephyr implements HAL_WDT and HAL_ADV but not every tier, and
# targets/efr32bg22-slc implements neither — and the alternative was
# a target that consumes nothing from shared/ for as long as one unimplemented HAL exists.
#
# THIS DOES NOT WEAKEN THE ONE-LIST RULE. OD_SHARED_SOURCES is COMPOSED from the tiers below, not
# hand-maintained beside them, so a file added to any tier still reaches the host tests and the
# ESP32 build automatically. Adding a source to a tier and forgetting the aggregate is not a
# possible mistake. Do not turn these into GLOBs and do not add a source to OD_SHARED_SOURCES
# directly — every source belongs to exactly one tier.
#
# A tier is a statement about LINKAGE, not about quality or readiness: od_config_tlv.c is PURE and
# also the most wire-sensitive file here.

# core/ and hal/ were missing until the first source landed and exposed it: with an empty

#
# ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING WHEN A TARGET CARRIES ITS OWN PROTOCOL HEADERS. Two shared headers pull
# in the wire contract by its bare name — od_config_asm.h includes "opendisplay_protocol.h",
# od_config_tlv.h includes "opendisplay_structs.h" — and both names also exist, as hand-written
# SUBSETS, in targets/nordic-zephyr/src/ (77 and 319 lines, against 991 and 1242 here). Neither
# quoted include resolves relative to shared/core, so whichever -I comes first wins.
#
# Getting that backwards is not a build error in the general case: od_config_tlv.c derives packet
# body sizes with sizeof on the canonical structs, so a subset that merely differs in layout
# yields a silently WRONG size table — a wire divergence introduced by an include path. A
# consumer whose own include dirs contain either name MUST put OD_SHARED_INCLUDE_DIRS ahead of
# them for the shared sources, per-source if the target's own translation units still need their
# copies. targets/nordic-zephyr/zephyr/CMakeLists.txt does exactly that and says so.
