/* aes128_test.c -- known-answer tests for the host AES-128 core.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS REGISTERED AND session_test.c IS NOT. This one has something to link today, and
 * it guards the foundation: every expected byte the session suite computes -- the KDF, the
 * session id, the auth proof, every CCM tag -- comes out of od_test_aes128_encrypt(). If it is
 * wrong, the session differential tests still agree with themselves and prove nothing. So the
 * vectors below are the standard's own, not values this implementation produced.
 *
 * Vectors: FIPS-197 Appendix B (the worked example) and Appendix C.1 (AES-128 key expansion
 * example), plus NIST SP 800-38A F.1.1 ECB-AES128 block 1.
