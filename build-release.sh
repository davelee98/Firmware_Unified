# THIS DRIVES THE PER-TARGET SCRIPTS, it does not reimplement them. Each target owns its
# toolchain activation (none of the three is on PATH), its board list, its artefact naming
# and its own release/MANIFEST-<target>.txt. Those manifests stay separate on purpose: a
# single shared one would only ever describe whichever target built last.
#
# EVERY TARGET RUNS EVEN IF AN EARLIER ONE FAILS, and the exit status is nonzero if any did.
# Stopping at the first failure would leave the other targets' artefacts in release/ from
# some previous run, with nothing on screen saying they are stale -- which is the failure
# mode a release directory is least able to survive.
#
# Only esp32-idf and nordic-zephyr are verified to build headless here. efr32bg22-slc builds
# but has never been flashed; see CLAUDE.md for the toolchain status of each.
